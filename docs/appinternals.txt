DESCRIPTION

Concepts:

resolver::
    Something that takes a version and resolves it to a specific
    version. Makes it possible to depend on a development version
    which is resolved later on.

Configuration properties:

`app.version`::
    The unresolved version of the application. Configured when the
    application is installed.

`app.resolved_version`::
    The resolved version of the application. Is updated by the
    resolved configured for the project.

`app.installed_version`::
    The installed version of the application. Is updated by
    `app-set-version`.
