NAME
----
app - your favorite application manager

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'app' <options>

QUICK START
~~~~~~~~~~~

    $ app init -d my-app maven org.example:my-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT
    $ cd my-app
    $ app start
    $ app conf set app.version 1.0
    $ app upgrade
    $ app restart

INSTALLING AN APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resolved and downloads an appliaction from a Maven repository:

    $ app init -d my-app maven org.example:my-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT

By default it will download from the central repository, but this is
not always what you want. To get it to use another repository give the
`-r` option:

    $ app init -d my-app maven -f http://repo.example.org/snapshots org.example:my-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT

UPGRADING AN APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application is configured with the Maven resolver and the
version is a SNAPSHOT version, you can use this to upgrade your
application through a cron job:

    $ app upgrade

With the resolver will try to resolve `app.version` to the latest
version. If it's change it will automatically download and install the
latest version.

CHANGING VERSION OF AN APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    $ app conf set app.version 1.0
    $ app sync-version

`app-sync-version` will first run the resolver to resolve the version
and if that has changed, it will download and install the new version.

TODOs
-----

* Consider renaming "upgrade" to "refresh" or "sync". Upgrade is an
  overloaded word, in particular since it might mean to download a
  catalog of applications instead of actually upgrading it. I'm always
  confused if I should use "upgrade" or "update".

* Find a way to check if an application is running.
