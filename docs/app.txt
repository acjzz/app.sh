app - your favorite application manager


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'app' <options>

INSTALLING AN APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This resolved and downloads an appliaction from a Maven repository:

    $ app init -d my-app maven org.example:my-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT

By default it will download from the central repository, but this is
not always what you want. To get it to use another repository give the
`-r` option:

    $ app init -d my-app maven -f http://repo.example.org/snapshots org.example:my-app:1.0-SNAPSHOT

UPGRADING AN APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application is configured with the Maven resolver and the
version is a SNAPSHOT version, you can use this to upgrade your
application through a cron job:

    $ app upgrade

With the resolver will try to resolve `app.version` to the latest
version. If it's change it will automatically download and install the
latest version.

CHANGING VERSION OF AN APPLICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    $ app conf set app.version 1.0
    $ app sync-version

`app-sync-version` will first run the resolver to resolve the version
and if that has changed, it will download and install the new version.

INTERNALS
---------

Concepts:

resolver::
    Something that takes a version and resolves it to a specific
    version. Makes it possible to depend on a development version
    which is resolved later on.

Configuration properties:

`app.version`::
    The unresolved version of the application. Configured when the
    application is installed.

`app.resolved_version`::
    The resolved version of the application. Is updated by the
    resolved configured for the project.

`app.installed_version`::
    The installed version of the application. Is updated by
    `app-set-version`.

TODOs
-----

* Consider renaming "upgrade" to "refresh". Upgrade is an overloaded
  word, in particular since it might mean to download a catalog of
  applications instead of actually upgrading it. I'm always confused
  if I should use "upgrade" or "update".

* Find a way to check if an application is running.
